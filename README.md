## AIM of the Project

The Aim of this project is to Demonstrate a Ground Robot (in our case its the [turtlebot3 burger](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/) from [Robotis](https://emanual.robotis.com/))
performing Autonomous Driving by Perception (perform Lane Detection and Autonomus Driving of the robot).The project has to done with the [ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic).

## Introduction

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open-source robotics middleware suite and a framework for robot software development, providing operating system-like functionality.ROS provides standard operating system services such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.

TurtleBot3(Burger) is a programmable ROS-based mobile robot used in research and education.The turtlebot3 burger has the sensor such as a [360 Laser Distance Sensor](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/appendix_lds_01/) and a [Raspberry Pi Camera Module](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-v2/), control borads such as [OpenCR1.0](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/appendix_opencr1_0/) (for low level control) and a Single Board Computer  [Raspberry Pi 3B+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)(for high level control and running ros Nodes).


**Autonomous Driving by Perception** with the turtlebot3 burger on the [autorace](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/autonomous_driving_autorace/) track can be done with the camera. The image caputred from the camera has to be processed by the Remote PC and make the robot autonomous Drive through the auto race track.
